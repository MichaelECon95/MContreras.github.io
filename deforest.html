									<h2>Overview</h2>
                                    <p>ForestQuery is a non-profit organization focused on reducing global deforestation. The leadership team seeks insights into global forestation trends from 1990 to 2016.</p>
									<hr />

									<header>
										<h2>The Problem</h2>
										<p>Their goal is to identify regions and countries where forests are diminishing and those with significant forest areas. This information will guide resource allocation to maximize impact.</p>

                                    <header>
										<h2>Test Setup</h2>
                                    </header>
										<li>Create SQL queries to understand datasets.</li>
                                        <li>Create View, “forestation”, by joining all three tables - forest_area, land_area and regions in the workspace.</li>
                                        <li>In the ‘forestation’ View, include the following: All of the columns of the origin tables.</li>
                                        <li>Create a new column that provides the percent of the land area that is designated as forest.</li> 
                                    <hr />

									<h2>Recommendation and Justification</h2>
                                    <h4></h4>
                                    </header>
									<p>After carefully examining the available data, it is clear that about 3% of the forest area has been destroyed. However, it is essential to pinpoint the precise regions in extreme need if you want to make a significant impact. A thorough examination of the growth outcomes attained in China leads to the conclusion that further research and study of the methods used there could significantly advance our knowledge of effective methods for the development of forests. Given China's vast land area, there are many lessons to be learned from their experiences, but we need also consider the insightful study data obtained from smaller nations where growth can be simpler to attain.</p>
                                    <p>While acknowledging Iceland's amazing growth rate of over 200% is significant, it's crucial to keep the main goal of this plan in mind. The location that requires priority attention is thus shown by the results below: Africa sub-Saharan. Sub-Saharan Africa is among the top 5 regions in terms of both square kilometers lost and percentage loss, but many other regions of the world demand attention. The greatest benefit to the world's forests would come from reforestation in this area.</p>
                                    <p>It is crucial to concentrate on the four key regions of Sub-Saharan Africa that have significant forest loss: Togo, Nigeria, Uganda, and Mauritania, in order to further focus our attention there. We can significantly aid in the restoration and preservation of forest areas by tackling the problems present in these locations.</p>
