                                            <b>Total Active Minutes:</b> This represents the sum of VeryActiveMinutes, FairlyActiveMinutes, and LightlyActiveMinutes. The distribution shows that most users have active minutes ranging from 0 to around 300 minutes daily, with a peak around 50 minutes.
                                            <p></p>
                                            <b>Sedentary Minutes:</b> This represents the time users are inactive. The distribution is right-skewed, indicating that a significant number of users have high sedentary minutes, with a peak around 600 minutes (or 10 hours).

                                            From this visualization, we can infer that while users do engage in active behaviors, they also spend a significant portion of their day being sedentary.
