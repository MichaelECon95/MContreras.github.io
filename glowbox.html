									<h2>Overview</h2>
                                    <p>GloBox is an online marketplace that specializes in sourcing unique and high-quality products from around the world.
                                        <blockquote>“We believe that shopping should be an adventure, and we want to bring the world to your doorstep. From exotic spices and rare teas to handmade jewelry and textiles, we have a curated selection of products that you won't find anywhere else.”</blockquote>

                                        GloBox is primarily known amongst its customer base for boutique fashion items and high-end decor products. However, their food and drink offerings have grown tremendously in the last few months, and the company wants to bring awareness to this product category to increase revenue.</p>

										<h2>The Problem</h2>
										<p>While GloBox is renowned for boutique fashion items and high-end decor, the recent expansion in the food and drink category required better visibility and promotion.</p>
									</header>
									<p>Objective: Assess the effectiveness of the banner in driving conversions.</p>
									<header>
                                    <hr />
                                    
                                    <header>
										<h2>Test Setup</h2>
                                    </header>
										<li>The experiment is only being run on the mobile website.</li>
                                        <li>A user visits the GloBox main page and is randomly assigned to either the control or test group. This is the join date for the user.</li>
                                        <li>The page loads the banner if the user is assigned to the test group, and does not load the banner if the user is assigned to the control group.</li>
                                        <li>The user subsequently may or may not purchase products from the website. It could be on the same day they join the experiment, or days later. If they do make one or more purchases, this is considered a “conversion”.
                                        </li> 
                                    <hr />
                                    
                                    <header>
									<h2>Recommendation and Justification</h2>
                                    <h4>Fullscale Launch of the Banner</h4>
                                    </header>
									<p>The surge in conversion rates, coupled with the banner's minimal operational overhead, makes a compelling case for its wider deployment. It not only highlights GloBox's evolving product portfolio but is also expected to enrich the user's browsing journey.
                                    <header>
                                        <h4>Business Factors</h4>
                                    </header>
                                    <p>Operational Cost: The seamless integration and upkeep of the banner bolster the recommendation.</p>
                                    <p>User Experience: The banner, emphasizing the food and drink category, is projected to enhance the browsing experience, fostering deeper user engagement.</p>

											<h3>Data Analysis performed </h3>
											<ol>
												<h5><li>Conduct a hypothesis test to determine whether there's a significant difference in the conversion rate between the two groups. Using the pooled proportion for the standard error and test at a 5% significance level.</li></h5>
                                                <p>Results:(3.8643, 0.0001)</p>
                                                <p>Given that the p-value is much less than the significance level of 0.05, we reject the null hypothesis. This means there is a statistically significant difference in the conversion rates between the two groups.</p>


												<h5><li>Calculate the 95% confidence interval for the difference in the conversion rate between the treatment and control groups (treatment - control).using the normal distribution and unpooled proportions for the standard error.</li></h5>
                                                <p>Results:(0.0035, 0.0107)</p>
                                                <p>This means that we are 95% confident that the difference in conversion rates between the test group (with the banner) and the control group (without the banner) lies within this interval.</p>

												<h5><li>Conduct a hypothesis test to determine if there's a significant difference in the average amount spent per user between the two groups. using the t-distribution and assume unequal variances.</li></h5>
                                                <p>Results: T-statistic: 0.0682, P-value: 0.95</p>
                                                <p>Given that the p-value is much greater than the significance level of 0.05, we fail to reject the null hypothesis. This indicates that there isn't a statistically significant difference in the average amount spent per user between the two groups.</p>

												<h5><li>Calculate the 95% confidence interval for the difference in the average amount spent per user between the treatment and control groups (treatment - control). using the t-distribution and assume unequal variances.</li></h5>
                                                <p>Results: The 95% confidence interval for the difference in the average amount spent per user between the treatment and control groups (treatment - control) is: (-0.439, 0.4708)</p>
                                                <p>This means that we are 95% confident that the difference in average amounts spent by users between the test group (with the banner) and the control group (without the banner) lies within this interval.</p>
